# Terrae

Terrae is a Massive Multiplayer Online (MMO) strategy game, based on a medieval word. All assets (natural and monetary resources, armies, buildings and others), are registered on blockchain in a decentralized way, with no server intervention. Players become real owners of their in-game assets. Thanks that, they are able to trade valuated assets (like NFT warriors or yield farming positions) and so, monetize their progress (and their valuated time invested in games).

## DEFI smart contracts outline integration

The current project aims to test basic functionalities in Terrae world tokenomics, considering:

- Denaris ERC20 token
- Resources ERC20 tokens
- Soldiers NFT tokens

The real project will be using the core basics soon.
